## 🌿 Introduction  

This repository is a curated collection of genealogical records, life summaries, and historical notes about my ancestors — as well as families and neighbors connected to them — from Puerto Rican towns including **Rincón, Añasco, Mayagüez, Aguada, and surrounding regions**.  
I am also including my AI prompts I am using in my Geanealogical research in the PROMPTS folder.

It complements the stories and research published on my blog [Looking4MyRoots.com](https://looking4myroots.com/), where I explore the lives, struggles, and migrations of Puerto Rican families from the 1800s through the mid-1900s.  

The purpose of this project is to:  
- Document ancestral life events through **verified, cited records**.  
- Preserve **community connections** among families who lived as neighbors, godparents, or witnesses.  
- Encourage others in the **Puerto Rican diaspora** to research and share their own histories.  
- Provide **bilingual narratives (English/Spanish)** to make Puerto Rican historical records accessible to all.  

> “By preserving one family’s story, we illuminate the shared history of an entire community.”
